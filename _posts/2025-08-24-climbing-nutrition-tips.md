Proper nutrition can be the difference between sending your project and pumping out halfway up. Here's how to fuel your body for optimal climbing performance.

## Pre-Climb Nutrition

### 2-3 Hours Before
Eat a balanced meal with:
- Complex carbohydrates (oatmeal, whole grain toast)
- Lean protein (eggs, Greek yogurt)
- Healthy fats (avocado, nuts)
- Hydration (16-20 oz water)

### 30-60 Minutes Before
Light snack if needed:
- Banana with almond butter
- Energy bar
- Handful of dates and nuts

## During Your Session

### Hydration is Key
- Drink 7-10 oz every 20 minutes
- Add electrolytes for sessions over 2 hours
- Signs of dehydration: headache, decreased performance, dark urine

### Quick Energy
For longer sessions (3+ hours):
- Fresh or dried fruit
- Energy gels or chews
- Trail mix
- Simple carbohydrates for quick energy

## Post-Climb Recovery

### Within 30 Minutes
The "golden window" for recovery:
- Protein shake or chocolate milk
- Protein bar with carbs
- Greek yogurt with granola

### Within 2 Hours
Complete meal with:
- Lean protein (chicken, fish, tofu)
- Complex carbs (rice, quinoa, sweet potato)
- Vegetables for micronutrients
- Healthy fats for inflammation reduction

## Daily Nutrition for Climbers

### Macronutrient Balance
- **Carbohydrates (45-65%)**: Primary fuel for climbing
- **Protein (15-25%)**: Muscle repair and recovery
- **Fats (20-35%)**: Hormone production and joint health

### Key Nutrients for Climbers

**Protein**: 0.8-1.2g per pound of body weight
- Supports muscle recovery
- Sources: lean meats, fish, beans, legumes

**Iron**: Essential for oxygen transport
- Sources: spinach, red meat, fortified cereals

**Calcium & Vitamin D**: Bone health
- Sources: dairy, fortified plant milk, sunlight

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Reduce inflammation
- Sources: salmon, walnuts, chia seeds

**Antioxidants**: Combat exercise-induced stress
- Sources: berries, dark leafy greens, colorful vegetables

## Sample Day of Eating

**Breakfast**: Overnight oats with berries, nuts, and protein powder

**Snack**: Apple with almond butter

**Lunch**: Quinoa bowl with grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and tahini dressing

**Pre-climb**: Banana and handful of dates

**Post-climb**: Protein shake with fruit

**Dinner**: Salmon, sweet potato, and saut√©ed greens

**Evening snack**: Greek yogurt with granola

## Hydration Strategy

- **Daily**: Half your body weight in ounces (minimum)
- **Training days**: Add 16-24 oz
- **Monitor**: Urine should be pale yellow
- **Electrolytes**: Important for cramping prevention

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Under-eating on climbing days
2. Not hydrating enough
3. Skipping post-workout nutrition
4. Too much caffeine, not enough water
5. Extreme dieting that impacts performance

## Special Considerations

**For Weight Management**:
- Focus on performance, not just weight
- Maintain adequate fuel for training
- Work with a sports nutritionist if needed

**For Competitions**:
- Practice your nutrition strategy during training
- Pack familiar foods
- Stay consistent with timing

Remember: Every climber is different. Experiment during training to find what works best for your body. The best diet is one that fuels your climbing while keeping you healthy and happy!
